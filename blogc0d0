		<description><![CDATA[Village Economic Empowerment (VEE) is an establishment of AVC Kenya. It has been operational since August 2012.

VEEâ€™s main objective is to form an independent, self reliant and sustaining society through training, equipping and empowering the marginalised groupings, youth, women and local communities.

Our focus is mainly on areas where poverty, illiteracy and healthcare are a major concern. We have our presence throughout Kenya, and in our neighboring countries, i.e. Uganda, Rwanda and Malawi.

We train communities on the best practices to scale up their economic activities, eradicating illiteracy through pre schools and learning centres for children and adult education, addressing healthcare issues by organizing workshop and providing medical health covers.]]></description>
